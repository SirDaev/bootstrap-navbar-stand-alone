# Stand-alone Bootstrap 3 Navbar
This is a stand-alone Bootstrap 3 Navbar including all necessary files. This allows you to use Bootstrap's navbar menu without having to include the entire Bootstrap framework as it only includes the CSS and JS needed for the navbar.

Current: Bootstrap v3.3.7

[Demo](https://sirdaev.github.io/bootstrap-navbar-stand-alone/)

These files include a direct pull from a [customized version of Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/), reproduceable using the config.json file. *bootstrap-theme.css* has been omitted for this repository.

## Files
html - complete example file set  
README.md - readme  
bootstrap.zip - customized Bootstrap direct download (using config.json)  
config.json - configuration for customized Bootstrap download

Example markup (html/index.html) taken from the [Navbar Template for Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/).

The idea for this was taken from [this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33975557).
